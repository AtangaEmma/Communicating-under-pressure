Difficult conversations often involve managing emotions and sensitive information, such as addressing poor performance, personal issues, grievances or offering reassurance during redundancies. 

It can often feel like a daunting experience, causing a lot of anxiety as individuals cannot control the facts, their emotions, the other person's emotions, or what happens next. 

It's natural to avoid difficult conversations, even if you're the right person for them, because you fear worsening the situation, making others feel bad, or lacking the skills to resolve it. 

Avoiding these conversations can lead to guilt, anger, and decreased confidence, ultimately affecting your performance and the team's success. 

As the instigator of the conversation, it's your responsibility to act as soon as it becomes apparent there's a problem, as avoiding the conversation could mislead the individual by giving the impression that they're doing well, denying them the chance to put things right. 

Act constructively, delivering clear, composed communications to help maintain good working relationships with colleagues, building confidence and cultivating trust. 

Challenging conversations can bring benefits to both parties, including improved relationships with colleagues as rapport increases and individuals are confident in your ability. 

Recognising your professionalism as you take ownership of the situation. 

It shows your reliability and credibility, helping you gain respect and boosting your confidence as you prove your capabilities in difficult situations.


## Planned conversations
A planned conversation gives both parties time to prepare and choose a suitable location, making difficult discussions easier by providing control and anticipating reactions. 

## Unplanned conversations  
Unplanned conversations, often driven by an unexpected incident or issue that generates strong emotions, can be more likely to be ineffective because the dialogue lacks structure. Reflect on these interactions to learn and improve for future occurrences.

## Influencing factors 
Communicating effectively under pressure requires emotional control to prevent escalation. Start by identifying your communication hang-ups, such as emotions, prejudices, and fear. 
For example, if you fear confrontation, you might delay difficult conversations or soften your message, reducing its impact. To overcome this, identify your emotional triggers, manage them, approach situations with an open mind, and stay calm by taking deep breaths. 
By addressing these hang-ups, you can communicate more confidently and effectively. 

## Emotions 
Regardless of the topic being discussed, it’s important that all parties involved in a difficult conversation can control their emotions, as these can influence how we behave and impact our ability to communicate, leaving others less receptive to what we have to say. 

## Know your triggers
Recognise your emotional triggers by understanding what causes them, such as threats to your status, relationships, or power.  
Keep a written record of anxious moments at work, noting the cause and your response. Do you react with aggression or freeze and back down? This helps you manage and control your emotions in the future. 

## Appropriate & inappropriate reactions
Instead of labelling emotions as positive or negative, consider them as appropriate or inappropriate for the situation. Happiness is generally positive but inappropriate when someone is being made redundant. Identify the appropriate reaction for the conversation based on the issue at hand. 

For example: if you’re discussing a colleague’s redundancy, recognise that showing empathy and understanding is appropriate, while displaying happiness would be inappropriate. 

## Re-label emotions 
A useful skill for controlling emotions is re-labelling them positively to boost confidence and courage. For example, switch fear to anticipation, frustration to desire, or alarm to curiosity. This technique takes practice but helps you move away from the fight-or-flight response, better managing workplace pressure. 

## Adopt a calm assertiveness 
When confronted by an emotionally charged situation it can help to adopt a calm assertiveness, especially if you're responsible for instigating the conversation. This can help manage your own emotions, as well as tempering the reaction of the other party as it encourages them to control theirs. 
To achieve this approach, it can help to clearly establish the level of pressure you're under by asking yourself two questions:  
Whether what you’ve imagined to be the worst is true?  

If you’re ok right now?  

If the answer is yes then it can help you reduce the fear, anxiety and strain you’re feeling,  increasing your ability to be calm. 

## Identifying emotions
As well as understanding your emotional triggers in general, it can also help to take time during the planning process to identity the emotions related to the conversation at hand. This including when it comes to starting the conversation, discussing the issue and dealing with the individual in question. 

## Starting the conversation 
Starting a conversation can be tough if you’re worried about the outcome and the other person’s reaction. Remember, their emotional response isn’t personally aimed at you but is their way of expressing feelings. Given time to reflect, their response might change.

## The issue
When thinking about and discussing the issue at hand, it’s important that you don’t allow your own feelings to cloud your judgement or impact how you believe it should be dealt with. Instead, you should take an open approach which is fair and consistent, following your organisation’s policy and procedures instead of your own subjective emotions.

## The individual   
Finally, consider your feelings about the person involved, as they can influence the conversation. If you like them, you might be inclined to soften the blow and give them the benefit of any doubt; if you clash, you might seek one-upmanship. Remove personal feelings to treat everyone equally and handle situations consistently.

## Difficult conversations 
Difficult conversations can increase stress, so it’s important to manage it. 

Replace stressful thoughts with positive ones to boost confidence. For example, instead of thinking “This will go badly,” think “I can handle this.” 

Where appropriate, discuss issues with an unbiased friend or family member to relieve tension and feel calmer. 

Before the conversation, take slow, controlled breaths. Inhale through your nose for a count of 10, hold briefly, then exhale for a count of 10. 

Repeat until you feel relaxed and ready. 

## Plan
Ideally, individuals will find themselves entering planned conversations when they’re required to communicate under pressure, meaning they have time to prepare for the exchange.

Identify the issue and prepare talking points, but be ready to adapt as the conversation evolves. 

Breakdown overwhelming problems into smaller chunks to discuss one by one. 

Challenge your assumptions to stay open minded and distinguish between opinions and facts.

Seek different perspectives to test for preconceptions. 

Examine your intentions to ensure they are relevant and aim to create value for all parties involved. 

Determine the purpose of the conversation and desired outcomes, recognising some outcomes may be predetermined, like in grievance discussions. 

Gather all relevant information and key points. 

Review your organisation policies to understand regulations and effectively counter any arguments such as those related to sickness absence, flexible working requests or dress code. 

Jot down key points, evidence, and your views, but stay flexible to handle various responses. 

Consider the individual's potential emotional reactions and choose a private face to face setting for the conversation. 

Seating arrangements matter. 

Sitting opposite shows formality, while sitting next to each other is less threatening. 

Inform the other party in advance to give them time to prepare, showing respect and allowing them to gather their thoughts and evidence. 

## Conversational structure 
Difficult conversations can be daunting and may require you to be more assertive. To manage fear and anxiety, reframe the conversation positively. Aiming for mutual understanding and being open to questioning your views and assumptions.

## The opening  
Start the conversation calmly and professionally to set the tone. Explain the meeting’s purpose, agree on behaviour standards, and ensure the other party can share their view. 

## Your side  
Present your side with facts and evidence, staying on key points and not getting derailed by emotions. Confront behaviour, not your assessment of it, to avoid defensiveness. 

## Their side  
Allow the other person to explain their perspective and listen carefully. Reflect on their input and ask questions to explore further. 

## The middle ground 
Work together to find a solution, negotiate if needed, and clarify responsibilities and timelines for actions. If there are agreed actions make sure all parties have the same understanding.

## Managing difficult conversations 

As you enter difficult conversations, it’s important to think carefully about how you communicate, as you’ll need to balance getting your point across and being sensitive to those involved, especially when the conversation takes place face-to-face.

Adopt an assertive approach to communication, as you need to ensure that you don't find yourself backing down or changing your mind during the conversation unless you've been presented with a good reason for doing so. 

Take your time by slowing down the pace and pausing before responding so you have time to think through what you're going to say, finding the right words to help diffuse a potentially negative emotional reaction. 

It can also help to give the other person space to think, as it can help them to answer fully and accurately. 

Have all the relevant facts at your disposal. 

If you're handling a performance issue, this might involve performance targets and the potential reasons for missing them. 

It's not enough to just have a gist of the situation, you need to take the time to gather and study information so you can understand what happened and why. 

Your choice of language during the conversation is critical as you want to minimise potential conflict by avoiding landmine language, words or phrases which elicit a negative response as their accusatory or condemnatory. 

Such as 'That's just typical of you' 

'You would say that' and 'you're being irrational.' 

Instead, you should remember to communicate with GRIT. (Generosity, respect, integrity and truth.) 

Starting sentences with 'I' statements to describe the behaviour, revealing the feeling it creates and explaining the impact it has on others. 

For example, when I hear you say this, I feel this which impacts this. 

As communication is only 7% verbal, you should also be aware of your body language, ensuring you adopt a positive position by uncrossing your arms, leaning slightly towards the other person, making regular eye contact and mirroring their behaviour when appropriate to create an atmosphere of trust and encourage rapport. 

Both sides will need to actively listen to what the other person is saying, as it's only when this skill is deployed that you can reach the level of understanding required to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Wait your turn to speak without rushing to fill pauses, as these present an opportunity to think, repeating back the other party's words if you require clarification. 

Once you've presented your side of the situation, you need to ensure you understand the other party's position by using open questions to elicit an insightful response into how the situation effects them personally. 

However, it's recommended that you avoid why questions as these tend to provoke people, causing them to become defensive. 

As difficult conversations tend to be highly emotional, it's important to recognise when to remain silent and when to talk. 

It may be better to wait for a more opportune time to hold the discussion. 

Finally, regardless of the conversation subject, you must remember that the other party has the right to be emotional about what's being discussed, especially if the news is unwelcome. 

Recognise this right and provide them with the opportunity to express their feelings as often the most valuable outcome from the conversation will be that they were heard.

## Communicating during a crisis

Sometimes difficult conversations can occur because of significant circumstances that can’t be avoided. Let’s look at how best to communicate with others amid a genuine crisis.

## Before  
Crisis management involves preparation as much as response. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans help prepare for unexpected events. As a line manager, ensure your staff are aware of BCDR strategies and complete mandatory training regularly. Stay updated on roadmap changes and inform strategy leaders of potential issues.

## Considered response
Throughout the conversation, you need to give your responses due consideration, recognising that the other person is likely to experience a range of emotions including fear, guilt, anger, vulnerability and frustration. All of which must be handled with care if the discussion is to reach a successful outcome.  


## In their shoes
Start by putting yourself in the other person’s shoes, thinking about how they might feel about what is discussed and how you would feel if the roles were reversed. 

Consider what drove them to behave in a way that warranted the conversation and ensure you evaluate your stance from all perspectives, challenging your assumptions and overcoming your biases before you start talking. 

However, it’s vital that whatever happens you do not start to play the victim, as this can undermine what you’re trying to achieve and is likely to alienate the other party. 


## Self-defence  
During difficult conversations, strong reactions are common due to self-defence instincts. Take these responses seriously, acknowledge their feelings, and give them time to regain composure. Reassure them that their feelings are natural. If needed, suggest a time out before continuing. 


## Show you care
Show the other person that you’re not just here to reprimand them, that you care about who they are and want to help them move forward and improve because of this conversation. 

Take an interest in the information they’re providing you with and remember that it should always be a two-way conversation. 

If there is a difference in opinion, why not try to soften your response by asking the other party to help you understand the situation from their perspective? 


## Be open & honest 
Finally, don’t take their responses personally, as this can cause you to put off the conversation. 

Instead approach the conversation as a means of finding out the truth, recognising that you can’t control how the other person responds, but that you can control your own behaviour so be open and honest throughout the exchange.
